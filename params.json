A butterfly? An alien? Be as creative as you like.**\r\nIn this session we’ll review the basics of p5.js and get everyone up and running with posting sketches online. We’ll look at how object-oriented programming works in JS and create simple sketches of objects moving around a canvas.\r\n\r\n##  [Assignment 2: Physics](http://cybermarinella.github.io/theNatureofCode/Assignment2-Physics/) 110%\r\n**Create a simulation entirely driven by forces.**\r\nThis session will look at the concept of a vector and implement sketches using a p5.Vector object. By creating objects with vectors for position, velocity, and acceleration, we’ll build a simple “hello world” physics engine.\r\n\r\n## [Assignment 3: Steering Forces](/Kadenze03-Steering Behaviors)\r\n**This assignment will have you creating your own simulation using steering forces.**\r\nThis session, we’ll examine a special kind of force (pioneered by Craig Reynolds) — a steering force — that moves an object according to its own goals or desires. Examples are wandering, seeking a target, path following, obstacle...",
