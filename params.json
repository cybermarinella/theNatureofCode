A butterfly? An alien? Be as creative as you like.**\r\nIn this session we’ll review the basics of p5.js and get everyone up and running with posting sketches online. We’ll look at how object-oriented programming works in JS and create simple sketches of objects moving around a canvas.\r\n\r\n##  [Assignment 2: Physics](http://cybermarinella.github.io/theNatureofCode/Assignment2-Physics/) 110%\r\n**Create a simulation entirely driven by forces.**\r\nThis session will look at the concept of a vector and implement sketches using a p5.Vector object. By creating objects with vectors for position, velocity, and acceleration, we’ll build a simple “hello world” physics engine.\r\n\r\n## Assignment 3: Steering Forces\r\nThis assignment will have you creating your own simulation using steering forces.",
